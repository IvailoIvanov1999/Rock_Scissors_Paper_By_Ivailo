#The "Rock-Scissors-Paper" game By-IvailoIvanov.

This is console game "Rock,Scissors,Paper".

In my first project i made Rock,Scissors,Paper. 

The game "Rock-Scissors-Paper" is a simple two players game .

Input : The player must enter "r" for rock , "s" for scissors ,"p" for paper.

Output : computer and player choose (r)or(s)or(p) and reveal the winner or draw .

                       The rules are :

1.Rock beats scissors (the rock is breaking the scissors).

2.Paper beats rock (the paper cover the rock).

3.Scissors beats paper ( scissors cut the paper).

If both players choices are same ,we say "Draw" and there is no winner !

EXAMPLES:

    Rock     ---   Rock     ---   Draw -("Draw" is because of the same choices)
                              
    Scissors   ---     Paper  ---   Player wins  -(with scissors player cuts the paper)
                                
    Rock      ---     Paper  ---     Player lose -(with paper 'pc' cover the rock )
